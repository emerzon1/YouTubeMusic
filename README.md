This is a program to download all songs in a Spotify playlist from YouTube. It makes a request to Spotify (you need to provide credentials), getting the songs, and then downloads each one from YouTube (you need googleapis credentials).  
It is very simple to use, just enter the link to the Spotify playlist (must be public) and the title of the folder the songs will go into.
If it is not working, just be sure to update all node dependencies.
Once downloaded, you can move the songs into Apple Music (and then sync with your phone) or just keep them on your computer as an offline playlist.
